This is the first try where I make a git with a README file all from vim and command line.
If I get good, this is what I will do in the future.
Well, in a way i must get good with this, cause this is what I want to do!
I really want to create using code...

Things I need to do in order to improve my skills:

Learn VIM
Learn to use git 
Learn Python
Learn HTML and simple Javascript

And that I guess is it..
